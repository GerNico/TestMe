Test Me
======
This project is a pet project. It is made in order to try myself in web application 
development using Spring, Hibernate and GWT. Later GWT will be replaced by angular.

Project is information portal for students, it should allow them to:
* login, maintain personal profiles with all information about userEntity
* select end pass courses
* read texts, watch video lessons
* pass tests and receive checked results

For the first steps it will be just system for plain online tests.

Also should exist userEntity-moderator which is able to:
* create tests and courses
* manage students activity, check their marks
